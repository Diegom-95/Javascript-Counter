## :question: About
This project is the final practice for start2impact Javascript Basic course, i hope you will enjoy it.
This absolutely my first project in Javascript language, created in early 2024.

The file index.html contains only the Open Paragraph tags and links to the style sheet and script. On the other hand, the script.js file contains, as requested, all the main code.
